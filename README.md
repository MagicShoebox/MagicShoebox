### Introduction
Hello! I am a recent graduate exploring career options in industry and academia.

### Projects
#### ðŸ“· Computer Vision
[Tiny Towns Scorer](https://github.com/MagicShoebox/vt-cs4664-tiny-towns-scorer) was made as part of an undergraduate capstone at Virginia Tech. In this group project, we developed a computer vision model to recognize tokens and their placement in the board game Tiny Towns. 
#### ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code
I've been participating in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for fun, learning, and practice since 2020. I used Python in [2020](https://github.com/MagicShoebox/advent-of-code-2020) and [2022](https://github.com/MagicShoebox/advent-of-code-2022), Haskell in [2021](https://github.com/MagicShoebox/advent-of-code-2021), and TypeScript for [2023](https://github.com/MagicShoebox/advent-of-code-2023).
