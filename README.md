### Introduction
Hello! I am a Software Engineer. I work primarily with .NET applications using C# but have some experience with a variety of tools, languages, and frameworks.
I double majored in Computer Science and Mathematics at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/) and am generally interested in cryptography, quantum computing, and cybersecurity.

### Projects
#### üéÑ Advent of Code
I've been participating in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for fun, learning, and practice since 2020:
  - [2020](https://github.com/MagicShoebox/advent-of-code-2020) (Python)
  - [2021](https://github.com/MagicShoebox/advent-of-code-2021) (Haskell) (+ a little Python)
  - [2022](https://github.com/MagicShoebox/advent-of-code-2022) (Python)
  - [2023](https://github.com/MagicShoebox/advent-of-code-2023) (TypeScript)
  - [2024](https://github.com/MagicShoebox/advent-of-code-2024) (Rust)
#### üì∑ Computer Vision
[Tiny Towns Scorer](https://github.com/MagicShoebox/vt-cs4664-tiny-towns-scorer) was made as part of an undergraduate capstone at Virginia Tech. In this group project, we developed a computer vision model to recognize tokens and their placement in the board game Tiny Towns.
#### üê±‚Äçüíª Bitburner
I played an open-source programming game called [Bitburner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/) for a little while. Since you write real Javascript in the game, I decided I might as well upload [my scripts](https://github.com/MagicShoebox/bitburner).

### Games
Just a few video games I've played recently that fellow puzzle-solvers might enjoy. I am not affiliated with any of these.
